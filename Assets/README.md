# Twilight Menu++ Theme Creation Assets

Are you interested in creating your own themes? Then you're at the right address. Files within this folder are meant to aid you in the creation and sharing of themes for Twilight Menu++. 

Using these, I hope to make this as easy as possible by using vector graphics. This allows you to easily recolor user interface elements, while still allowing you to import raster images like PNG and JPG in the process. Really the best of both worlds!

The 3DS theme assets were manually vectorized by me, using example skins provided by the DS-Homebrew Wiki Page [How to Create DSi/3DS Skins](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/twilightmenu/custom-dsi-3ds-skins) as reference. **Please download and use these example skins yourself**, since these show which variants you need to export. 


## Usage

In order to use files within this folder, you will need [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), a free and open source vector graphics editor available for Windows, macOS and Linux. If you already have it, make sure it's the latest version. You will also need the example skins, which you can find on the site above.

For general information on usage, you can read the information below. Note that this isn't meant to be a tutorial on how to use Inkscape.

### Editing

After opening the SVG file using Inkscape, I recommend opening the 'Layers and Objects' panel by either pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + L`, or `Layers > Layers and Objects` in the top menu bar. By hovering on the names, you can hide or show objects and layers, and lock or unlock them. Use these options to export all the variants needed. It also makes it easier to select individual elements within the file to recolor them. 

Once you selected an element you wish to recolor, you can open the `Fill and Stroke` tab by clicking on the element's color next to `Fill:` or `Stroke:` in the bottom left corner of the screen. You can also select one of the colors in the color strip if you desire (hold `SHIFT` while selecting a color to change the stroke).

To add your own background, you can select the `BackgroundElement` layer and copy the desired file. Paste it inside of Inkscape, and it should appear!

If you need to change the order of the object you're editing, you can use the `Page Up` or `Page Down` keys, or `Object > Raise / Lower`.

### Exporting

After editing, you can export the files to PNG by pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + E` or `File > Export...`. Make sure that the document is set to `Page`, and that the width and height are set to 256 and 192 respectively. 

You will see a preview of the image it will export. Choose where you want to export your file, and then press `Export`.

Do this for every variant (for example, `bottom.png`, `bottom_ds.png`, `bottom_bubble.png` etc).
